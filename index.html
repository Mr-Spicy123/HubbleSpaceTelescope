        <div class="intro">
            The Hubble Space Telescope is a NASA probe launched in 1990 that traveled far across the universe, discovering and capturing many incredible phenomena. It is known for the incredible images it took with their bright, vibrant colours, and for the many different applications it brought to the world from its advanced technology.

            <b>Expanding our understanding of the universe</b>
            <div class="benefit-text">
                Hubble’s discoveries have widely expanded our understanding of scientific subjects like our solar system and dark matter, and our views of planets, nebulae, galaxies, and star fields. Hubble’s brilliant images of these celestial beings have shaped how we picture them.

            <div class="benefit-text">
                These images have reached both science museums, recognizing its incredible achievements, and art museums, showing the beautiful photos taken by it. These encourage humans to imagine our deep universe with immense galaxies with bright and vibrant colours that we don’t see often on Earth.

            <div class="benefit-text">
                One of the Hubble’s most iconic photos is the Pillars of Creation, a cluster of gas and dust that rises up against a brilliant blue background, spanning about 4 to 5 lightyears inside the Eagle Nebula.

            <div class="benefit-text">
                Every image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope has an immense power that compels the viewer with its bright, vibrant colours and the fact that what we are looking at are real places in the universe.

                Scientists and Engineers created lots of new technology for Hubble, and, along the way, found applications for it on Earth. The technology that was used for Hubble’s camera were used to increase the contrast on the scrolls of the Dead Sea allowing these 2000-year-old documents to finally be read.

            <div class="benefit-text">
                One of the parts in Hubble’s camera, the CCD, turned light into digital images and this was applied to create a better, cheaper, faster, less painful and biopsy system with less exposure to radiation. These were used to better identify breast cancer in the early stages, so that it could be treated and give the patient a better chance of surviving.

            <div class="benefit-text">
                Hubble’s technology also led to the creation of a monitoring system to preserve historical documents like the Charter of Freedoms. This system sensed degradation invisible to the human eye in these documents, and conservators were able to act early and treat it before the damage increases.

                The Hubble’s technology also helped an Olympian win a gold medal in speed skating and set a new world record. The tool was a polish that, when applied to the Olympian's skates, provided a smooth glide, reducing friction. The tool’s use on the Hubble was to polish mirrors for the optics system.

                Hubble was revolutionary for the astronomical community but also had many important applications to life on Earth.

            <b>Finding the age of the universe</b>
            <div class="benefit-text">
                To calculate the age of the universe, astronomers first needed to calculate the expansion rate of the universe. Edwin Hubble was the first to have observational evidence that the universe has a finite age, and he called it the Hubble constant. He noticed that far away galaxies seem to move through space at a faster rate. However, the uncertainty over this rate was off by a factor of two, leaving a very wide range of how old the universe could be, from 9.7 billion years to 19.5 billion years.
            </div>
            <div class="benefit-text">
                Finally, The Hubble Space Telescope allowed astronomers to produce astronomical calculations that were a lot more precise, achieving an extraordinary precise measurement of the expansion rate of the universe using several complementary observing strategies. The most accurate way to find the expansion rate of the universe, are cepheids. Scientists can calulate distance based on the brightness of these stars. HST was able to discover over 800 Cepheids in 24 nearby galaxies. With the data collected by the Hubble Space Telescope, astrophysicists were able to calculate the age of the universe to be 13.8 billion years old.
