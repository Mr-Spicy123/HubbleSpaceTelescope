            <b>Expanding our understanding of the universe</b>
            <div class="benefit-text">
                Hubble’s discoveries have widely expanded our understanding of scientific subjects like our solar system and dark matter, and our views of planets, nebulae, galaxies, and star fields. Hubble’s brilliant images of these celestial beings have shaped how we picture them. 
            </div>
            <div class="benefit-text">
                These images have reached both science museums, and art museums. These encourage humans to imagine our deep universe with immense galaxies,	 and other celestial beings that we can explore.

            <div class="benefit-text">
                One of the Hubble’s most iconic photos is the Pillars of Creation, a cluster of gas and dust that rise up against a brilliant blue background.

            <div class="benefit-text">
                Every viewer of the Hubble’s images was compelled by the bright, powerful colours and the fact that these photos are real places in our universe.

            <div class="benefit-text">
                The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) made many discoveries that changed astronomy forever. It answered lots of astronomical questions like the discovery of dark matter and the age of the universe. 
            </div>
            <div class="benefit-text">
                Hubble has made such an incredible impact, it is woven into our culture by appearing in industries like film, music, art, etc and tattoos, stamps, shirts, and television. 
            </div>
            <div class="benefit-text">
                Scientists and Engineers created lots of new technology for Hubble, and, along the way, found some of this technology has applications on Earth. The technology that was used for Hubble’s camera were used to increase the contrast on the scrolls of the dead sea allowing them to be read. The technology in Hubble’s camera turned light into digital images and this was used to create a better, cheaper, faster, less painful and biopsy system with less exposure to radiation. These were used to better identify breast cancer in the early stages, so that it could be treated and possibly save the patient’s life. Hubble’s technology also lead to the creation of The Charter of Freedoms Monitoring System which sensed degradation invisible to the human eye, and conservators were able to act early and treat it. The Hubble also helped an Olympian win a gold medal with a polish that reduced friction and provided a smoother glide.

                Lessons were learned from Hubble’s missions and have altered the way people work in space.

                Hubble was revolutionary for the astronomical community. It has changed the way astronomy happens, expanding potential on Earth.

            <b>Finding the age of the universe</b>
            <div class="benefit-text">
                To calculate the age of the universe, the expansions rate of the universe needed to be found. Edwin Hubble was the first to have observational evidence that the universe has a finite age and calculated by E. Hubble called the Hubble constant. He noticed that far away galaxies seem to move through space at a faster rate. However, the uncertainty over this rate was off by a factor of two, leaving a very wide range of how old the universe is (9.7 billion years – 19.5 billion years).

            <div class="benefit-text">
                Astronomers continued making more precise distance measurements. By 1990, the rate was reduced to an error of just 10%. 
            </div>
            <div class="benefit-text">
                Finally, The Hubble Space Telescope allowed astronomers to produce astronomical calculations that were a lot more precise, achieving an extraordinary precise measurement of the expansion rate of the universe using several complementary observing strategies. The most accurate way to find the expansion rate of the universe, are cepheids. HST was able to discover over 800 Cepheids in 24 nearby galaxies. With the data collected by the Hubble Space Telescope, astrophysicists were able to calculate the age of the universe to be 13.8 billion years old.
